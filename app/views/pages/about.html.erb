  <h2>Why I created Sofia</h2>
    <p>
    In high school my favourite subjects were Latin and Greek. I absolutely loved dissecting all these old texts, and reading someone's thoughts from many centuries ago. After high school however, I kind of forgot about my passion for the classical languages. I realised recently how much I miss reading authors like Ovid, Plato, and Virgil. I decided to create a place where I can collect and show classical texts and translations in an aesthetically pleasing manner. I hope you enjoy this web app as much as I enjoyed making it.
    </p>
    <h2>My translations</h2>
    <p>When I started working on Sofia, I wanted to do everything myself. This includes the actual translations. However, I quickly realised that I do not have the time to write enough translations for this web app to make sense. Therefore I have turned to the <%= link_to "Perseus", "http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/" %> project of Tufts University. They have the biggest collection of classical texts and translations available, and the open-source nature of Perseus allows me to use many of their texts.</p>
    <h2>How to use Sofia</h2>
    <p>
    Sofia is structured by authors, works, and chapters. You can search for the author you're looking for on the home page, and then navigate to the right chapter (denoted by titles and line numbers) with the menus.
    </p>
    <p>
    The original texts can be viewed in conjunction with the translations. There are a couple ways to obtain information about the grammar and the link between the translation and the original text. There is a toggle that shows the cases of all the words in the text. In addition, hovering over a word highlights the corresponding translation (or original). If you have any ideas on other functionality that you would like to see, then hit me up on my <%= link_to "twitter", "https://www.twitter.com/casvanderhoven" %> or <%= link_to "email", "mailto:casvanderhoven" %>.
